    </p> Flat world presets are one of the most popular world options in the Java edition, which is finally set to make its way to the Bedrock edition as part of the developer's efforts in parity. Java edition used to have this world type since it was added officially during the 1.1 update. Now, more players will have access to this mode. </p>
</p> The update will finally add flat world presets such as classic flat, tunneler's dream, water world, overworld, and more. These flat worlds are great for those who love making mega builds or for trying out mob farms before implementing them in-game. </p>
</p> 2) Happy ghast and associated items </p>

    </p>
</p> The happy ghast was one of the major highlights of Minecraft Live 2025, so it comes as no surprise that players are excited to try this new mob as part of the release edition. The update will add the dried ghast, ghastlings, and the adult happy ghast. Players can rescue dried ghasts from the Nether and submerge them to get the Ghastlings. These can be fed snowballs to spawn the adult variant. </p>
</p> Apart from this, the update is also set to bring the harness. This nifty item will allow players to tame the happy ghast and ride it like a huge airship. This adds a major new way for transportation in the game, allowing gamers to reach greater heights and even build sky bases with ease. </p>

<p>The locator bar will replace the experience bar when multiple players are in the world, adding a colored indicator for each player present. Additionally, they can hide from the bar by crouching and wearing mob heads or carved pumpkins. They can also use potions of invisibility to evade the locator, making it one of the coolest features of the update.</p>

<p>4) Vibrant Visuals</p>

This will significantly transform the current look of the game and provide modern graphics styles.</p>
<p>Additionally, Vibrant Visuals is set to become the default visual style for all compatible devices. Players will also be able to head into settings and modify individual parameters of the feature to better suit their gameplay or device specifications.</p>
